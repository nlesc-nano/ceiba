 🧬 🔭 🔬 Scientific simulations generate large volume of data that needs to be stored and processed
by multidisciplinary teams across different geographical locations. Distributing computational expensive
simulations among the available resources, avoiding duplication and keeping the data safe are challenges
that scientists face every day.

Ceiba and its command line interface Ceiba-cli. Ceiba solves the problem of computing, storing and securely sharing
computationally expensive simulation results. Researchers can save significant time and resources by easily
computing new data and reusing existing simulation data to answer their questions.

See `documentation <https://ceiba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
